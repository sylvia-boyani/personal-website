                       Hello, I am sylvia. I was born in kisii bomachoge i am a second born 
                       in a family of four girls and my mom. I have been raised in Kibra and 
                       that's where am currently living. I've lived here for the last 2 decades.
                       Growing up here has not been easy it has it challenges but we survive day by
                       day.
    
                       <h4>Hobbies</h4>
                       I like;
                       <ul>
                           <li>swimming</li>
                           <li>walking</li>
                           <li>Cooking</li>
                           <li>Eating</li>
                       </ul>
                       I learnt how to swim 🏊🏽‍♀️ when i was in class 5. And from then it has been my 
                       favourite sport.
                       Ilove walking 🚶🏾‍♀️. It clears my mind and am able to relax and alsoenjoy music while  walking
                       I've been cooking for the longest time. I can't really remember when i started
                       to cook but since then i love cooking 👩🏽‍🍳👩🏽‍🍳and also love seeing people enjoy my cooking.
                       And after cooking comes the eating. I like eating,😋😋😋 Who doesn't🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
